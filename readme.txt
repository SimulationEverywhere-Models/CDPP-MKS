The mks simulation can be run by placing the mks folder as a subdirectory of the directory holding the simu.exe environment.
Mks.bat will run simu against mks.ma, and then run drawlog to make a .drw
The mks.drw file can then be loaded into cd++ guimodeler to visualize the results.
Note that this model does not incorporate calculated inertial delays yet,
